This is an attempt to get bing Co-pilot to generate a Python version of metaqa


Sure! Here's the updated Python code that includes reading SQL statements from two files provided as command-line parameters:

### Updated Python Code
```python
import sqlite3
import sys

def convert_type(value):
    """Convert data types to a common format for comparison."""
    try:
        return float(value)
    except ValueError:
        return str(value)

def read_sql_from_file(filename):
    """Read SQL statement from a file."""
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        return file.read()

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python script.py <sql_file1> <sql_file2>")
        return

    sql_file1 = sys.argv[1]
    sql_file2 = sys.argv[2]

    try:
        # Read SQL statements from files
        sql_query1 = read_sql_from_file(sql_file1)
        sql_query2 = read_sql_from_file(sql_file2)

        # Establish first database connection
        conn1 = sqlite3.connect('your_database1.db')
        cursor1 = conn1.cursor()

        # Execute a query on the first database
        cursor1.execute(sql_query1)
        rows1 = cursor1.fetchall()

        # Establish second database connection
        conn2 = sqlite3.connect('your_database2.db')
        cursor2 = conn2.cursor()

        # Execute a query on the second database
        cursor2.execute(sql_query2)
        rows2 = cursor2.fetchall()

        # Perform comparison logic
        for row1 in rows1:
            match_found = False
            for row2 in rows2:
                # Assuming both tables have the same structure and column names
                if all(convert_type(row1[i]) == convert_type(row2[i]) for i in range(len(row1))):
                    match_found = True
                    break
            if match_found:
                print(f"Match found for row: {row1}")
            else:
                print(f"No match found for row: {row1}")

        # Close the connections
        conn1.close()
        conn2.close()
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Command-Line Arguments**: The script expects two command-line arguments, which are the filenames containing the SQL statements.
2. **read_sql_from_file Function**: This function reads the SQL statement from a given file.
3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the SQL statements from the provided files, executes them on the respective databases, and performs the comparison logic.

### Usage
To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python script.py sql_file1.sql sql_file2.sql
```

Replace `sql_file1.sql` and `sql_file2.sql` with the actual filenames containing your SQL queries.
